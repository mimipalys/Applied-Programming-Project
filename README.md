Project Description:
An application that aims to digitalize business cards using NFC tags. Users can edit their digital business card and save it on their own NFC tag. Users can then use the scan option on the application to scan that NFC tag and get the business card on their app. These business cards are stored in the library section in which users can view all the business cards they have "collected".

Current Progress:
